# Introduction

**Last updated:** `r LastRunTime` UK TIME

Hello and thanks for visiting my page on COVID19 exploratory data analysis. I have made this site as a learning exercise but also to better understand the current state of the pandemic at multiple levels.

There are many more plots and perspective I would like to exploit and that I am currently working on:

* Bubble map over time and by exact location
* Graph of the reproduction number (R0) over time
* Graphs of the global statistics
* Log10 switch for the amounts of people tested positive, dead or recovered
* Give context and explanations to the graphics

If you have any other suggestions please get in touch at [luis.chaves15@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:luis.chaves15@imperial.ac.uk).

Data sources:

* [Corona Virus dataset @ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset)

Some amazing resources:

* [John Hopkins University dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
* [SARS-COV2 phylogenetic tree](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)
* [COVID19 scenario explorer](https://neherlab.org/covid19/)

_**Disclaimer:**_ This is the first website project I get involved in so things may not work as smoothly as I would want them too! If you encounter the site being too laggy, do let me know! I am working to make it be smoother and take less time to load.

_**Disclaimer 2:**_ The whole website is interactive! Have fun playing with the graphs!

# Up-to-date numbers by continent and by country

## Table view
```{r}
selectInput("table", label = "By",
            choices = c("Continent", "Country","Full"), selected = "Country")
```

```{r warning = F, message = F}
sum.table = readRDS("ProcessedData/sumtable.rds")
continent.wise =  readRDS("ProcessedData/continentWise.rds")
```

```{r}
renderTable(
  switch(input$table,
         "Country"=sum.table %>% head(20),
         "Continent"=continent.wise,
         "Full"=sum.table),
  digits = 0
)
```

## Up-to-date number of events by location

```{r}
selectInput("t.choice", label = "Event/Metric",
            choices = c("Deaths(D)", "Recovered(R)","Confirmed(C)",
                        "D/C ratio", "R/C ratio"), selected = "Deaths(D)")
```

```{r}
ItalyDC = round(with(sum.table[sum.table$Country.Region == "Italy",], Deaths/Confirmed),4)*100
GermanyDC = round(with(sum.table[sum.table$Country.Region == "Germany",], Deaths/Confirmed),4)*100
```

```{r}
renderText(
  if (input$t.choice=="D/C ratio"){
    paste0("In this graph we can clearly see how the virus (and potentially different strains of the virus) are affecting every country. As of today, Italy has a case-fatality rate (CFR) of ", as.character(ItalyDC), "% where as Germany has a CFR of ", as.character(GermanyDC), "% suggesting the strain in Germany is way less deadly than the italian strain.")
  }
)
```


```{r}
renderPlotly(
  if (input$t.choice == "Deaths(D)"){
    deads
  } else if (input$t.choice == "Confirmed(C)") {
    conf
  } else if (input$t.choice == "Recovered(R)") {
    rec
  } else if (input$t.choice == "D/C ratio") {
    deaths_conf
  } else if (input$t.choice == "R/C ratio") {
    rec_conf
  }
)
```

# COVID19 over time - Timelines

## Cumulative number of events over time

```{r}
selectInput("plt.time.choice", label = "Event/Metric",
            choices = c("Deaths(D)", "Recovered(R)",
                        "Confirmed(C)", "Active(A)"), selected = 20)
```

```{r}
renderPlotly(
  if (input$plt.time.choice == "Deaths(D)"){
    plt_deaths_time
  } else if (input$plt.time.choice == "Confirmed(C)") {
    plt_conf_time
  } else if (input$plt.time.choice == "Recovered(R)") {
    plt_rec_time
  }  else if (input$plt.time.choice == "Active(A)") {
    plt_act_time
  }
)
```

## Number of events per day over time

The value for any day is the difference of the cumulative cases/deaths/recoveries for that day day and the day before then.

```{r}
selectInput("plt.day.choice", label = "Event/Metric",
            choices = c("Deaths(D)", "Recovered(R)",
                        "Confirmed(C)"), selected = 20)
```


```{r}
renderPlotly(
  if (input$plt.day.choice == "Deaths(D)"){
    d_daytime
  } else if (input$plt.day.choice == "Confirmed(C)") {
    conf_daytime
  } else if (input$plt.day.choice == "Recovered(R)") {
    rec_daytime
  }
)
```

## Barplots over time

Over time from `r format(min(all_time$Date),"%B %dnd")` to  `r format(max(all_time$Date),"%B %dnd")`

```{r message = F}
selectInput("barplot", label = "Type of barplot",
            choices = c("Stacked bars", "By event"), selected = "Stacked bars")

renderPlotly(
  switch(input$barplot,
         "Stacked bars" = bar_over_time,
         "By event" = byevent)
)
```
